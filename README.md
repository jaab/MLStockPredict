# MLStockPredict

## Overview

The ML Stock Predict is designed for analyzing historical stock data, making predictions, and visualizing the results. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter for easy interaction. It allows users to analyze historical stock data, visualize trends, and make buy/sell predictions based on moving averages.

## Features

- Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using `yahoo_fin`.
- Implements various technical indicators such as Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
- Predicts Buy (1) or Sell (0) signals based on the technical indicators.
- Allows users to analyze stocks by inputting stock symbols and date ranges.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier for signal prediction.
- Performs hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search to optimize model performance.
- Displays accuracy, sentiment, classification report, and confusion matrix in the GUI.
- Visualize closing prices, moving averages, and buy/sell signals.
- Train a machine learning model for buy/sell predictions.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy and additional classification metrics.
